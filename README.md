# Data Analysis Project
This project is designed to perform data analysis using various Python packages. It includes scripts to process and analyze datasets, generating insights from the data. The details of the required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, you can download it from python.org.

## Virtual Environment Setup
To ensure that all Python dependencies are installed in an isolated environment, it's recommended to use a virtual environment (venv).

### Steps to create and use the virtual environment:
#### 1. Navigate to the project folder
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```
#### 2. Create the virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
This will create a folder named venv in your project, which contains the virtual environment.
#### 3. Activate the virtual environment
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### 4. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Project Summary
This project involves analyzing data using Python. It uses libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and others listed in requirements.txt to process and analyze datasets, producing insights. The main scripts for analysis can be found in the project directory.
